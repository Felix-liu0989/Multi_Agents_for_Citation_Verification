{"idx": 1, "dataset": "longbench-chat", "query": "How is the Motif algorithm applied in this paper?", "answer": ["The Motif algorithm has the following main applications in this paper: 1. The Motif algorithm is used as a fully-supervised baseline model for comparison with the authors' visual remote-supervised model. Specifically, Motif is a very strong baseline for current scene graph generation tasks. The authors trained the Motif model in a fully supervised setting and compared it with the remotely supervised model on the Visual Genome dataset, which showed that the remotely supervised model outperformed Motif.2. The Motif algorithm was used to implement the denoising framework in the paper. Specifically, in step E, the authors use the current parameter θ to predict the remotely labeled data to obtain the probability distribution of the relational labels, where θ is learned through the Motif model. In the M step, the authors use the remote labeled data maximize the log likelihood of the Motif model to update the parameter θ.3. In the semi-supervised setting, Motif is also used for pre-training and fine-tuning. The Motif model is first pre-trained with remotely labeled data and then fine-tuned on manually labeled data to obtain better performance. 4. \\In the ablation study of the article, Raw Label means using only remote labels, and Motif means training the Motif model on remote labels. The comparison results show that significant improvement can be obtained by utilizing Motif for model training on remote labels. 5. In order to investigate the denoising effect with different number of iterations, the authors conducted multiple rounds of training. In each round, the Motif model was used to learn a new parameter θ and to update the label distribution of the remotely labeled data. The results show that two rounds of iteration can obtain better denoising performance.  Summing up, the Motif algorithm plays a very crucial role in this paper, not only as a benchmark for comparison, but also as a means to implement the various components of the remote supervision framework, thus demonstrating the improvements that can be achieved with remote supervision compared to full supervision."], "few_shot_scores": [{"answer": " In the paper \"Visual Distant Supervision for Scene Graph Generation,\" the Motif algorithm is used as a strong baseline for comparison with the proposed visual distant supervision approach. The Motif algorithm is a neural network architecture designed for scene graph generation, which is a task that aims to identify objects and their relations in images.\n\nThe authors of the paper compare their distantly supervised model with the Motif algorithm in both fully supervised and semi-supervised settings. The Motif algorithm is trained on the Visual Genome dataset with human-annotated data, which serves as the ground truth for the scene graph generation task. The authors then evaluate the performance of their distantly supervised model against the Motif model in terms of predicate classification, scene graph classification, and scene graph detection.\n\nThe Motif model is implemented with ResNeXt-101-FPN as the backbone, which is a common practice in the field of computer vision. The authors also fine-tune the Motif model on their distantly labeled data to demonstrate the potential of their proposed denoising framework for visual distant supervision.\n\nIn summary, the Motif algorithm is used as a benchmark to show the effectiveness of the proposed visual distant supervision approach and its denoising framework in improving the performance of scene graph generation models, even without the need for human-labeled data.", "score": 6}, {"answer": "In this paper, the authors use the Neural Motif (Motif) algorithm proposed by Zellers et al. as a base scene graph generation model.

In summary, the Motif algorithm is used as the base scene graph generation model in this work to enable fair comparisons to prior state-of-the-art methods and analyze the benefits of incorporating distant supervision strategies.

{"idx": 4, "dataset": "longbench-chat", "query": "What aspects of the LLAMA Long model proposed above have changed relative to the LLAMA-based model? What improvements have been made?", "answer": ["The LLAMA Long model makes the following major improvements and changes over the base LLAMA model: 1. **Processing of Long Sequences**: the LLAMA Long model is able to efficiently process context windows up to 32,768 word tokens long, which is superior to the relatively shorter context processing capabilities of the LLAMA model. 2. **Continuous Pre-training**: the LLAMA Long model was obtained by continuous pre-training of the LLAMA 2 model, which used longer training sequences and oversampled long text. 3. **Adjustment of Positional Encoding**: the LLAMA Long model makes adjustments to the original positional encoding. By decreasing the rotation angle (controlled by the \"base frequency b\"), the attenuation effect on distant markers is reduced. 4. **Data Mixing**: The LLAMA Long model explored different ways of data mixing in pre-training, including adjusting the proportion of LLAMA 2 pre-training data or adding new long text data. 5. **Instruction fine-tuning**: The LLAMA Long model uses a simple but effective instruction fine-tuning procedure that allows it to outperform the gpt-3.5-turbo-16k model in long context tasks without the need for manually labeled long instruction data. The above improvements and changes allow the LLAMA Long model to achieve significant performance gains on long context tasks and achieve comparable or better performance than the LLAMA 2 model on most regular tasks. In addition, the 70B version of the LLAMA Long model is able to exceed the overall performance of the gpt-3.5-turbo-16k model across a range of long context tasks through a cost effective instruction tuning process."], "few_shot_scores": [{"answer": " The LLAMA Long model series, as proposed in the paper, introduces several changes and improvements relative to the original LLAMA model. These enhancements are aimed at supporting effective context windows of up to 32,768 tokens and improving performance on both short and long-context tasks. The key changes and improvements include:\n\n1. **Continual Pretraining**: The LLAMA Long models are built by continually pretraining from LLAMA 2 checkpoints with additional 400 billion tokens formed as longer training sequences. This approach allows the models to learn from more context and adapt to longer sequences without significant computational overhead.\n\n2. **Positional Encoding Modifications**: The original LLAMA 2's positional encoding (PE) was found to limit the model's ability to aggregate information from distant tokens. The LLAMA Long models adopt a modification to the RoPE positional encoding by decreasing the rotation angle (controlled by the hyperparameter \"base frequency b\"), which reduces the decaying effect of RoPE for distant tokens. This change improves the model's ability to handle long dependencies.\n\n3. **Data Mix**: The pretraining data mix for the LLAMA Long models includes a combination of existing datasets used by LLAMA 2 and new long text data. The quality of the data is found to be more critical than the length of texts for long-context continual pretraining.\n\n4. **Instruction Tuning**: The LLAMA Long models use a simple and cost-effective procedure for instruction tuning without requiring human-annotated long instruction data. This involves augmenting the RLHF dataset with synthetic self-instruct long data generated by LLAMA 2 CHAT itself, allowing the model to learn a diverse set of skills and transfer that knowledge to long-context scenarios.\n\n5. **Performance Improvements**: The LLAMA Long models demonstrate consistent improvements on most regular tasks and significant improvements on long-context tasks compared to LLAMA 2. Notably, the 70B variant can surpass gpt-3.5-turbo-16k’s overall performance on a suite of long-context tasks after a cost-effective instruction tuning procedure.\n\n6. **Scaling Behavior**: The models show a clear power-law scaling behavior with respect to context lengths, suggesting that context length is another important axis of scaling LLMs. The model's performance can continually improve as the context length increases up to 32,768 tokens.\n\n7. **Safety Evaluations**: The LLAMA Long models maintain the safety performance of the original LLAMA 2 series, as validated through responsible safety evaluations.\n\nIn summary, the LLAMA Long models have been optimized for handling longer contexts through architectural modifications, data augmentation, and training strategies that enhance their performance on a wide range of tasks, particularly those requiring long-context understanding.", "score": 10}, {"answer": "Based on the paper, here are the key changes and improvements made in the LLAMA Long model compared to the original LLAMA model:  Architecture Changes: - Modified the positional encoding (RoPE) to reduce the decay effect for distant tokens, allowing the model to attend to much longer contexts (up to 32,768 tokens).  Pretraining Approach:  - Used continual pretraining, starting from LLAMA 2 checkpoints and training on additional 400 billion tokens formed into long sequences. This is more efficient than pretraining from scratch.  - Tested different pretraining data mixes and found that often data quality plays a bigger role than having abundant long texts.  Performance Improvements: - Achieves consistent improvements over LLAMA 2 on most regular short-context benchmarks, especially coding, math and knowledge tasks.  - Demonstrates significant gains on long-context tasks like summarization, question answering, etc over both LLAMA 2 and other existing open-sourced long-context models.  - After lightweight instruction tuning without human supervision, the chat model can surpass GPT-3.5-Turbo on a suite of long-context benchmarks.  So in summary, through modifications to enable longer context, continual pretraining approach, and self-supervised instruction tuning, the LLAMA Long model achieves better performance on both short and long context tasks compared to prior LLAMA variants.", "score": 8}, {"answer": "Based on the doc, some key aspects of the LLAMA Long model that have changed relative to the LLAMA-based model include:  1) The LLAMA Long model is continually pretrained from LLAMA 2 checkpoints with additional 400B tokens using longer sequences. This provides more context for the model to learn from.  2) The positional encoding (PE) used in LLAMA 2 has been modified - the base frequency of the ROPE PE has been increased from 10,000 to 500,000 to reduce the decay of the attention scores for distant tokens. This allows the model to attend to longer ranges.  3) There is an improved data mix in the pretraining, with a greater ratio of long text data compared to the original LLAMA 2 pretraining. This provides more long context data for the model to learn from.   4) There is a lightweight instruction tuning procedure that does not require human-annotated long context data. The model is fine-tuned using a mix of short and long context prompts generated by LLAMA 2 itself. This avoids the need for costly and difficult human annotation.  5) On downstream benchmarks like language modeling and question answering, the LLAMA Long model achieves significantly better performance compared to the original LLAMA 2 model. This demonstrates the improvements gained through the modifications described above.  In summary, the LLAMA Long model improves on the original LLAMA 2 model by utilizing more context, optimizing the PE, using an improved data mix, and fine-tuning using self-instruct data in a way that does not require costly long context data.

406 ; 407 ; 448 ].Furthermore, AgentVerse [410 ]\nconstructs a versatile, multi-task-tested framework for group agents cooperation.It can assemble a\nteam of agents that dynamically adapt according to the task’s complexity.To promote more efficient\ncollaboration, researchers hope that agents can learn from successful human cooperation examples\n[109 ].MetaGPT [405 ] draws inspiration from the classic waterfall model in software development,\nstandardizing agents’ inputs/outputs as engineering documents.By encoding advanced human process\nmanagement experience into agent prompts, collaboration among multiple agents becomes more\nstructured.However, during MetaGPT’s practical exploration, a potential threat to multi-agent cooperation has\nbeen identified.Without setting corresponding rules, frequent interactions among multiple agents can\namplify minor hallucinations indefinitely [405 ].For example, in software development, issues like\nincomplete functions, missing dependencies, and bugs that are imperceptible to the human eye may\narise.Introducing techniques like cross-validation [109 ] or timely external feedback could have a\npositive impact on the quality of agent outputs.4.2.2 Adversarial Interaction for Advancement\nTraditionally, cooperative methods have been extensively explored in multi-agent systems.However,\nresearchers increasingly recognize that introducing concepts from game theory [ 449 ; 450 ] into\nsystems can lead to more robust and efficient behaviors.In competitive environments, agents can\nswiftly adjust strategies through dynamic interactions, striving to select the most advantageous or\nrational actions in response to changes caused by other agents.Successful applications in Non-\nLLM-based competitive domains already exist [360 ; 451 ].AlphaGo Zero [452 ], for instance, is\nan agent for Go that achieved significant breakthroughs through a process of self-play.Similarly,\nwithin LLM-based multi-agent systems, fostering change among agents can naturally occur through\ncompetition, argumentation, and debate [ 453 ; 454 ].By abandoning rigid beliefs and engaging in\nthoughtful reflection, adversarial interaction enhances the quality of responses.Researchers first delve into the fundamental debating abilities of LLM-based agents [129 ; 412 ].Findings demonstrate that when multiple agents express their arguments in the state of “tit for tat”,\none agent can receive substantial external feedback from other agents, thereby correcting its distorted\nthoughts [112 ].Consequently, multi-agent adversarial systems find broad applicability in scenarios\nrequiring high-quality responses and accurate decision-making.In reasoning tasks, Du et al.[111 ]\nintroduce the concept of debate, endowing agents with responses from fellow peers.When these\nresponses diverge from an agent’s own judgments, a “mental” argumentation occurs, leading to\nrefined solutions.ChatEval [171 ] establishes a role-playing-based multi-agent referee team.Through\nself-initiated debates, agents evaluate the quality of text generated by LLMs, reaching a level of\nexcellence comparable to human evaluators.The performance of the multi-agent adversarial system has shown considerable promise.However,\nthe system is essentially dependent on the strength of LLMs and faces several basic challenges:\n• With prolonged debate, LLM’s limited context cannot process the entire input.• In a multi-agent environment, computational overhead significantly increases.• Multi-agent negotiation may converge to an incorrect consensus, and all agents are firmly convinced\nof its accuracy [111].The development of multi-agent systems is still far from being mature and feasible.Introducing\nhuman guides when appropriate to compensate for agents’ shortcomings is a good choice to promote\nthe further advancements of agents.4.3 Interactive Engagement between Human and Agent\nHuman-agent interaction, as the name suggests, involves agents collaborating with humans to accom-\nplish tasks.With the enhancement of agent capabilities, human involvement becomes progressively\nessential to effectively guide and oversee agents’ actions, ensuring they align with human require-\nments and objectives [455 ; 456 ].Throughout the interaction, humans play a pivotal role by offering\n30\n\nDesigning an energy-\nsaving product.Instruct\n/ Feedback\nOutput\nPerpetual motion is\nimpossible.Human as instructor\nAgent as executor\nIt's tough, everything feels heavy right now.So stressed lately, can't get myself to do anything.The product is a\nperpetual motion\nmachine capable of...\n5/10\nThe product is\ncapable of efficient...\nYeah, thanks for understanding.Instructor-Executor Paradigm \nEqual Partnership Paradigm\nFigure 10: Two paradigms of human-agent interaction.In the instructor-executor paradigm (left),\nhumans provide instructions or feedback, while agents act as executors.In the equal partnership\nparadigm (right), agents are human-like, able to engage in empathetic conversation and participate in\ncollaborative tasks with humans.guidance or by regulating the safety, legality, and ethical conduct of agents.This is particularly crucial\nin specialized domains, such as medicine where data privacy concerns exist [457 ].In such cases,\nhuman involvement can serve as a valuable means to compensate for the lack of data, thereby facili-\ntating smoother and more secure collaborative processes.Moreover, considering the anthropological\naspect, language acquisition in humans predominantly occurs through communication and interaction\n[ 458 ], as opposed to merely consuming written content.As a result, agents shouldn’t exclusively\ndepend on models trained with pre-annotated datasets; instead, they should evolve through online\ninteraction and engagement.The interaction between humans and agents can be classified into two\nparadigms (see Figure 10): (1) Unequal interaction (i.e., instructor-executor paradigm): humans\nserve as issuers of instructions, while agents act as executors, essentially participating as assistants to\nhumans in collaboration.(2) Equal interaction (i.e., equal partnership paradigm): agents reach the\nlevel of humans, participating on an equal footing with humans in interaction.4.3.1 Instructor-Executor Paradigm\nThe simplest approach involves human guidance throughout the process: humans provide clear and\nspecific instructions directly, while the agents’ role is to understand natural language commands from\nhumans and translate them into corresponding actions [459 ; 460 ; 461 ].In §4.1, we have presented\nthe scenario where agents solve single-step problems or receive high-level instructions from humans.Considering the interactive nature of language, in this section, we assume that the dialogue between\nhumans and agents is also interactive.Thanks to LLMs, the agents are able to interact with humans\nin a conversational manner: the agent responds to each human instruction, refining its action through\nalternating iterations to ultimately meet human requirements [190 ].While this approach does achieve\nthe goal of human-agent interaction, it places significant demands on humans.It requires a substantial\namount of human effort and, in certain tasks, might even necessitate a high level of expertise.To\nalleviate this issue, the agent can be empowered to autonomously accomplish tasks, while humans\nonly need to provide feedback in certain circumstances.Here, we roughly categorize feedback into\ntwo types: quantitative feedback and qualitative feedback.Quantitative feedback.The forms of quantitative feedback mainly include absolute evaluations\nlike binary scores and ratings, as well as relative scores.Binary feedback refers to the positive and\nnegative evaluations provided by humans, which agents utilize to enhance their self-optimization\n[ 462 ; 463 ; 464 ; 465 ; 466 ].Comprising only two categories, this type of user feedback is often\neasy to collect, but sometimes it may oversimplify user intent by neglecting potential intermediate\nscenarios.To showcase these intermediate scenarios, researchers attempt to expand from binary\nfeedback to rating feedback, which involves categorizing into more fine-grained levels.However, the\nresults of Kreutzer et al.[ 467 ] suggest that there could be significant discrepancies between user and\nexpert annotations for such multi-level artificial ratings, indicating that this labeling method might be\n31\n\ninefficient or less reliable.Furthermore, agents can learn human preference from comparative scores\nlike multiple choice [468; 469].Qualitative feedback.Text feedback is usually offered in natural language, particularly for re-\nsponses that may need improvement.The format of this feedback is quite flexible.Humans provide\nadvice on how to modify outputs generated by agents, and the agents then incorporate these sug-\ngestions to refine their subsequent outputs [ 470 ; 471 ].For agents without multimodal perception\ncapabilities, humans can also act as critics, offering visual critiques [ 190 ], for instance.Additionally,\nagents can utilize a memory module to store feedback for future reuse [472].In [473], humans give\nfeedback on the initial output generated by agents, prompting the agents to formulate various improve-\nment proposals.The agents then discern and adopt the most suitable proposal, harmonizing with the\nhuman feedback.While this approach can better convey human intention compared to quantitative\nfeedback, it might be more challenging for the agents to comprehend.Xu et al.[ 474 ] compare various\ntypes of feedback and observe that combining multiple types of feedback can yield better results.Re-training models based on feedback from multiple rounds of interaction (i.e., continual learning)\ncan further enhance effectiveness.Of course, the collaborative nature of human-agent interaction also\nallows humans to directly improve the content generated by agents.This could involve modifying\nintermediate links [ 189 ; 475 ] or adjusting the conversation content [ 421].In some studies, agents can\nautonomously judge whether the conversation is proceeding smoothly and seek feedback when errors\nare generated [476 ; 477 ].Humans can also choose to participate in feedback at any time, guiding the\nagent’s learning in the right direction [420].Currently, in addition to tasks like writing [ 466 ] and semantic parsing [463 ; 471 ], the model of using\nagents as human assistants also holds tremendous potential in the field of education.For instance,\nKalvakurth et al.[413 ] propose the robot Dona, which supports multimodal interactions to assist\nstudents with registration.Gvirsman et al.[478 ] focus on early childhood education, achieving\nmultifaceted interactions between young children, parents, and agents.Agents can also aid in human\nunderstanding and utilization of mathematics [414 ].In the field of medicine, some medical agents\nhave been proposed, showing enormous potential in terms of diagnosis assistance, consultations, and\nmore [ 416 ; 417 ].Especially in mental health, research has shown that agents can lead to increased\naccessibility due to benefits such as reduced cost, time efficiency, and anonymity compared to face-to-\nface treatment [479 ].Leveraging such advantages, agents have found widespread applications.Ali et\nal.[418 ] design LISSA for online communication with adolescents on the autism spectrum, analyzing\nusers’ speech and facial expressions in real-time to engage them in multi-topic conversations and\nprovide instant feedback regarding non-verbal cues.Hsu et al.[ 415 ] build contextualized language\ngeneration approaches to provide tailored assistance for users who seek support on diverse topics\nranging from relationship stress to anxiety.Furthermore, in other industries including business, a\ngood agent possesses the capability to provide automated services or assist humans in completing\ntasks, thereby effectively reducing labor costs [419 ].Amidst the pursuit of AGI, efforts are directed\ntowards enhancing the multifaceted capabilities of general agents, creating agents that can function\nas universal assistants in real-life scenarios [422].4.3.2 Equal Partnership Paradigm\nEmpathetic communicator.With the rapid development of AI, conversational agents have garnered\nextensive attention in research fields in various forms, such as personalized custom roles and virtual\nchatbots [ 480].It has found practical applications in everyday life, business, education, healthcare,\nand more [ 481 ; 482 ; 483 ].However, in the eyes of the public, agents are perceived as emotionless\nmachines, and can never replace humans.Although it is intuitive that agents themselves do not possess\nemotions, can we enable them to exhibit emotions and thereby bridge the gap between agents and\nhumans?Therefore, a plethora of research endeavors have embarked on delving into the empathetic\ncapacities of agents.This endeavor seeks to infuse a human touch into these agents, enabling them to\ndetect sentiments and emotions from human expressions, ultimately crafting emotionally resonant\ndialogues [484; 485 ; 486 ; 487 ; 488 ; 489 ; 490 ; 491 ].Apart from generating emotionally charged\nlanguage, agents can dynamically adjust their emotional states and display them through facial\nexpressions and voice [ 423 ].These studies, viewing agents as empathetic communicators, not only\nenhance user satisfaction but also make significant progress in fields like healthcare [415 ; 418 ; 492 ]\nand business marketing [ 424 ].Unlike simple rule-based conversation agents, agents with empathetic\ncapacities can tailor their interactions to meet users’ emotional needs [493].32\n\nHuman-level participant.Furthermore, we hope that agents can be involved in the normal lives of\nhumans, cooperating with humans to complete tasks from a human-level perspective.In the field\nof games, agents have already reached a high level.As early as the 1990s, IBM introduced the\nAI Deep Blue [ 451 ], which defeated the reigning world champion in chess at that time.However,\nin pure competitive environments such as chess [451 ], Go [360 ], and poker [ 494 ], the value of\ncommunication was not emphasized [ 426 ].In many gaming tasks, players need to collaborate with\neach other, devising unified cooperative strategies through effective negotiation [425 ; 426 ; 495 ; 496 ].In these scenarios, agents need to first understand the beliefs, goals, and intentions of others, formulate\njoint action plans for their objectives, and also provide relevant suggestions to facilitate the acceptance\nof cooperative actions by other agents or humans.In comparison to pure agent cooperation, we desire\nhuman involvement for two main reasons: first, to ensure interpretability, as interactions between\npure agents could generate incomprehensible language [495 ]; second, to ensure controllability, as the\npursuit of agents with complete “free will” might lead to unforeseen negative consequences, carrying\nthe potential for disruption.Apart from gaming scenarios, agents also demonstrate human-level\ncapabilities in other scenarios involving human interaction, showcasing skills in strategy formulation,\nnegotiation, and more.Agents can collaborate with one or multiple humans, determining the shared\nknowledge among the cooperative partners, identifying which information is relevant to decision-\nmaking, posing questions, and engaging in reasoning to complete tasks such as allocation, planning,\nand scheduling [ 427 ].Furthermore, agents possess persuasive abilities [ 497 ], dynamically influencing\nhuman viewpoints in various interactive scenarios [428].The goal of the field of human-agent interaction is to learn and understand humans, develop technology\nand tools based on human needs, and ultimately enable comfortable, efficient, and secure interactions\nbetween humans and agents.Currently, significant breakthroughs have been achieved in terms of\nusability in this field.In the future, human-agent interaction will continue to focus on enhancing user\nexperience, enabling agents to better assist humans in accomplishing more complex tasks in various\ndomains.The ultimate aim is not to make agents more powerful but to better equip humans with\nagents.Considering practical applications in daily life, isolated interactions between humans and\nagents are not realistic.Robots will become colleagues, assistants, and even companions.Therefore,\nfuture agents will be integrated into a social network [ 498 ], embodying a certain level of social value.5 Agent Society: From Individuality to Sociality\nFor an extended period, sociologists have frequently conducted social experiments to observe specific\nsocial phenomena within controlled environments.Notable examples include the Hawthorne Experi-\nment\n2 \nand the Stanford Prison Experiment\n3\n.Subsequently, researchers began employing animals\nin social simulations, exemplified by the Mouse Utopia Experiment\n4\n.However, these experiments\ninvariably utilized living organisms as participants, made it difficult to carry out various interventions,\nlack flexibility, and inefficient in terms of time.Thus, researchers and practitioners envision an inter-\nactive artificial society wherein human behavior can be performed through trustworthy agents [521 ].From sandbox games such as The Sims to the concept of Metaverse, we can see how “simulated\nsociety” is defined in people’s minds: environment and the individuals interacting in it.Behind\neach individual can be a piece of program, a real human, or a LLM-based agent as described in the\nprevious sections [ 22 ; 522; 523 ].Then, the interaction between individuals also contributes to the\nbirth of sociality.In this section, to unify existing efforts and promote a comprehensive understanding of the agent\nsociety, we first analyze the behaviors and personalities of LLM-based agents, shedding light on their\njourney from individuality to sociability (§ 5.1).Subsequently, we introduce a general categorization\nof the diverse environments for agents to perform their behaviors and engage in interactions (§ 5.2).Finally, we will talk about how the agent society works, what insights people can get from it, and the\nrisks we need to be aware of (§ 5.3).The main explorations are listed in Figure 11.2\nhttps://www.bl.uk/people/elton-mayo\n3\nhttps://www.prisonexp.org/conclusion/\n4\nhttps://sproutsschools.com/behavioral-sink-the-mouse-utopia-experiments/\n33\n\nAgent Society: From In-\ndividuality to Sociability\nBehavior and\nPersonality §5.1\nSocial\nBehavior §5.1.1\nIndividual behaviors\nPaLM-E [ 120 ], Reflexion [169 ],\nVoyager [ 190 ], LLM+P [125],\nCoT [95 ], ReAct [ 91 ], etc.Group behaviors\nChatDev [ 109 ], ChatEval [171 ], AutoGen\n[ 406 ], RoCo [ 403], ProAgent [407 ],\nAgentVerse [410 ], Xu et al.[ 499 ], etc.Personality §5.1.2\nCognition\nBinz et al.[500 ], Dasgupta et\nal.[ 501 ], Dhingra et al.[ 502 ],\nHagendorff et al.[ 503 ], etc.Emotion\nWang et al.[ 504], Curry\net al.[505 ], Elyoseph et al.[ 506 ], Habibi et al.[ 507 ], etc.Character \nCaron et al.[508], Pan et al.[509 ], Li\net al.[510 ], Safdari et al.[ 511 ], etc.Social\nEnvironment §5.2\nText-based\nEnvironment §5.2.1\nTextworld [512], Urbanek et al.[ 513 ], Hausknecht et al.[ 514 ], Am-\nmanabrolu et al.[432 ], CAMEL\n[ 108 ], Hoodwinked [515 ], etc.Virtual Sandbox\nEnvironment §5.2.2\nGenerative Agents [ 22 ], AgentSims\n[ 174], Minedojo [337 ], Voyager [ 190 ],\nPlan4mc [401 ], SANDBOX [ 27 ], etc.Physical\nEnvironment §5.2.3\nInteractive Language [ 333 ], PaLM-E [120],\nRoboAgent [516], AVLEN [ 375 ], etc.Society\nSimulation §5.3\nGenerative Agents [ 22 ], AgentSims\n[ 174], Social Simulacra [ 517 ], S\n3\n[ 518], RecAgent [519 ], Williams\net al.[520 ], SANDBOX [ 27 ], etc.Figure 11: Typology of society of LLM-based agents.5.1 Behavior and Personality of LLM-based Agents\nAs noted by sociologists, individuals can be analyzed in terms of both external and internal dimensions\n[ 524].The external deals with observable behaviors, while the internal relates to dispositions, values,\nand feelings.As shown in Figure 12, this framework offers a perspective on emergent behaviors and\npersonalities in LLM-based agents.Externally, we can observe the sociological behaviors of agents\n(§ 5.1.1), including how agents act individually and interact with their environment.Internally, agents\nmay exhibit intricate aspects of the personality (§ 5.1.2), such as cognition, emotion, and character,\nthat shape their behavioral responses.5.1.1 Social Behavior\nAs Troitzsch et al.[ 525 ] stated, the agent society represents a complex system comprising individual\nand group social activities.Recently, LLM-based agents have exhibited spontaneous social behaviors\nin an environment where both cooperation and competition coexist [499 ].The emergent behaviors\nintertwine to shape the social interactions [518].Foundational individual behaviors.Individual behaviors arise through the interplay between\ninternal cognitive processes and external environmental factors.These behaviors form the basis of\nhow agents operate and develop as individuals within society.They can be classified into three core\ndimensions:\n• \nInput behaviors refers to the absorption of information from the surroundings.This includes\nperceiving sensory stimuli [ 120 ] and storing them as memories [169].These behaviors lay the\ngroundwork for how an individual understands the external world.• \nInternalizing behaviors involve inward cognitive processing within an individual.This category\nencompasses activities such as planning [125 ], reasoning [ 95 ], reflection [ 91 ], and knowledge pre-\ncipitation [ 108 ; 405 ].These introspective processes are essential for maturity and self-improvement.• Output behaviors constitute outward actions and expressions.The actions can range from object\nmanipulation [ 120 ] to structure construction [190 ].By performing these actions, agents change the\nstates of the surroundings.In addition, agents can express their opinions and broadcast information\n34\n\nIndividual\nHuman & Resources\nSimulated Agent Society\nVirtual Env or Physical Env\nAction\nPerception\nInternalizing\nBehaviors\nToM\nPersonality\nGroup\nAgent\nEnvironment\nFigure 12: Overview of Simulated Agent Society.The whole framework is divided into two parts:\nthe Agent and the Environment.We can observe in this figure that: (1) Left: At the individual level,\nan agent exhibits internalizing behaviors like planning, reasoning, and reflection.It also displays\nintrinsic personality traits involving cognition, emotion, and character.(2) Mid: An agent and\nother agents can form groups and exhibit group behaviors, such as cooperation.(3) Right: The\nenvironment, whether virtual or physical, contains human actors and all available resources.For a\nsingle agent, other agents are also part of the environment.(4) The agents have the ability to interact\nwith the environment via perception and action.to interact with others [ 405 ].By doing so, agents exchange their thoughts and beliefs with others,\ninfluencing the information flow within the environment.Dynamic group behaviors.A group is essentially a gathering of two or more individuals partici-\npating in shared activities within a defined social context [526 ].The attributes of a group are never\nstatic; instead, they evolve due to member interactions and environmental influences.This flexibility\ngives rise to numerous group behaviors, each with a distinctive impact on the larger societal group.The categories of group behaviors include:\n• Positive group behaviors are actions that foster unity, collaboration, and collective well-being\n[ 22 ; 109 ; 171; 403 ; 406 ; 407 ].A prime example is cooperative teamwork, which is achieved\nthrough brainstorming discussions [ 171 ], effective conversations [ 406 ], and project management\n[ 405 ].Agents share insights, resources, and expertise.This encourages harmonious teamwork and\nenables the agents to leverage their unique skills to accomplish shared goals.Altruistic contributions\nare also noteworthy.Some LLM-based agents serve as volunteers and willingly offer support to\nassist fellow group members, promoting cooperation and mutual aid [410].• Neutral group behaviors.In human society, strong personal values vary widely and tend toward\nindividualism and competitiveness.In contrast, LLMs which are designed with an emphasis on\nbeing “helpful, honest, and harmless” [527 ] often demonstrate a tendency towards neutrality [ 528 ].This alignment with neutral values leads to conformity behaviors including mimicry, spectating,\nand reluctance to oppose majorities.• \nNegative group behaviors can undermine the effectiveness and coherence of an agent group.Conflict and disagreement arising from heated debates or disputes among agents may lead to\ninternal tensions.Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that agents may exhibit confrontational\nactions [499 ] and even resort to destructive behaviors, such as destroying other agents or the\nenvironment in pursuit of efficiency gains [410].35\n\n5.1.2 Personality\nRecent advances in LLMs have provided glimpses of human-like intelligence [ 529 ].Just as human\npersonality emerges through socialization, agents also exhibit a form of personality that develops\nthrough interactions with the group and the environment [530 ; 531 ].The widely accepted definition\nof personality refers to cognitive, emotional, and character traits that shape behaviors [532 ].In the\nsubsequent paragraphs, we will delve into each facet of personality.Cognitive abilities.Cognitive abilities generally refer to the mental processes of gaining knowledge\nand comprehension, including thinking, judging, and problem-solving.Recent studies have started\nleveraging cognitive psychology methods to investigate emerging sociological personalities of LLM-\nbased agents through various lenses [ 500 ; 502 ; 503 ].A series of classic experiments from the\npsychology of judgment and decision-making have been applied to test agent systems [501 ; 500 ;\n502 ; 533 ].Specifically, LLMs have been examined using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) to\nunderscore their capacity for deliberate thinking beyond mere intuition [ 534 ; 535 ].These studies\nindicate that LLM-based agents exhibit a level of intelligence that mirrors human cognition in certain\nrespects.Emotional intelligence.Emotions, distinct from cognitive abilities, involve subjective feelings and\nmood states such as joy, sadness, fear, and anger.With the increasing potency of LLMs, LLM-based\nagents are now demonstrating not only sophisticated reasoning and cognitive tasks but also a nuanced\nunderstanding of emotions [31].Recent research has explored the emotional intelligence (EI) of LLMs, including emotion recognition,\ninterpretation, and understanding.Wang et al.found that LLMs align with human emotions and values\nwhen evaluated on EI benchmarks [504 ].In addition, studies have shown that LLMs can accurately\nidentify user emotions and even exhibit empathy [505 ; 506 ].More advanced agents are also capable\nof emotion regulation, actively adjusting their emotional responses to provide affective empathy [ 423 ]\nand mental wellness support [ 507 ; 536].It contributes to the development of empathetic artificial\nintelligence (EAI).These advances highlight the growing potential of LLMs to exhibit emotional intelligence, a crucial\nfacet of achieving AGI.Bates et al.[ 537 ] explored the role of emotion modeling in creating more\nbelievable agents.By developing socio-emotional skills and integrating them into agent architectures,\nLLM-based agents may be able to engage in more naturalistic interactions.Character portrayal.While cognition involves mental abilities and emotion relates to subjective\nexperiences, the narrower concept of personality typically pertains to distinctive character patterns.To understand and analyze a character in LLMs, researchers have utilized several well-established\nframeworks like the Big Five personality trait measure [508 ; 538 ] and the Myers–Briggs Type\nIndicator (MBTI) [ 508; 509 ; 538 ].These frameworks provide valuable insights into the emerging\ncharacter traits exhibited by LLM-based agents.In addition, investigations of potentially harmful\ndark personality traits underscore the complexity and multifaceted nature of character portrayal in\nthese agents [510].Recent work has also explored customizable character portrayal in LLM-based agents [511 ].By\noptimizing LLMs through careful techniques, users can align with desired profiles and shape diverse\nand relatable agents.One effective approach is prompt engineering, which involves the concise\nsummaries that encapsulate desired character traits, interests, or other attributes [ 22 ; 517 ].These\nprompts serve as cues for LLM-based agents, directing their responses and behaviors to align with\nthe outlined character portrayal.Furthermore, personality-enriched datasets can also be used to train\nand fine-tune LLM-based agents [539 ; 540 ].Through exposure to these datasets, LLM-based agents\ngradually internalize and exhibit distinct personality traits.5.2 Environment for Agent Society\nIn the context of simulation, the whole society consists of not only solitary agents but also the\nenvironment where agents inhabit, sense, and act [541 ].The environment impacts sensory inputs,\naction space, and interactive potential of agents.In turn, agents influence the state of the environment\nthrough their behaviors and decisions.As shown in Figure 12, for a single agent, the environment\n36\n\nrefers to other autonomous agents, human actors, and external factors.It provides the necessary\nresources and stimuli for agents.In this section, we examine fundamental characteristics, advantages,\nand limitations of various environmental paradigms, including text-based environment (§ 5.2.1),\nvirtual sandbox environment (§ 5.2.2), and physical environment (§ 5.2.3).5.2.1 Text-based Environment\nSince LLMs primarily rely on language as their input and output format, the text-based environment\nserves as the most natural platform for agents to operate in.It is shaped by natural language\ndescriptions without direct involvement of other modalities.Agents exist in the text world and rely\non textual resources to perceive, reason, and take actions.In text-based environments, entities and resources can be presented in two main textual forms,\nincluding natural and structured.Natural text uses descriptive language to convey information, like\ncharacter dialogue or scene setting.For instance, consider a simple scenario described textually:\n“You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.There is a small\nmailbox here” [512 ].Here, object attributes and locations are conveyed purely through plain text.On the other hand, structured text follows standardized formats, such as technical documentation\nand hypertext.Technical documentation uses templates to provide operational details and domain\nknowledge about tool use.Hypertext condenses complex information from sources like web pages\n[389 ; 388 ; 391 ; 392 ] or diagrams into a structured format.Structured text transforms complex details\ninto accessible references for agents.The text-based environment provides a flexible framework for creating different text worlds for\nvarious goals.The textual medium enables environments to be easily adapted for tasks like interactive\ndialog and text-based games.In interactive communication processes like CAMEL [108 ], the text\nis the primary medium for describing tasks, introducing roles, and facilitating problem-solving.In text-based games, all environment elements, such as locations, objects, characters, and actions,\nare exclusively portrayed through textual descriptions.Agents utilize text commands to execute\nmanipulations like moving or tool use [ 432 ; 512 ; 514 ; 515 ].Additionally, agents can convey emotions\nand feelings through text, further enriching their capacity for naturalistic communication [513].5.2.2 Virtual Sandbox Environment\nThe virtual sandbox environment provides a visualized and extensible platform for agent society,\nbridging the gap between simulation and reality.The key features of sandbox environments are:\n• Visualization.Unlike the text-based environment, the virtual sandbox displays a panoramic view\nof the simulated setting.This visual representation can range from a simple 2D graphical interface\nto a fully immersive 3D modeling, depending on the complexity of the simulated society.Multiple\nelements collectively transform abstract simulations into visible landscapes.For example, in the\noverhead perspective of Generative Agents [22], a detailed map provides a comprehensive overview\nof the environment.Agent avatars represent each agent’s positions, enabling real-time tracking\nof movement and interactions.Furthermore, expressive emojis symbolize actions and states in an\nintuitive manner.• \nExtensibility.The environment demonstrates a remarkable degree of extensibility, facilitating\nthe construction and deployment of diverse scenarios.At a basic level, agents can manipulate the\nphysical elements within the environment, including the overall design and layout of architecture.For instance, platforms like AgentSims [ 174 ] and Generative Agents [ 22 ] construct artificial towns\nwith buildings, equipment, and residents in grid-based worlds.Another example is Minecraft, which\nprovides a blocky and three-dimensional world with infinite terrain for open-ended construction\n[ 190 ; 337 ; 401 ].Beyond physical elements, agent relationships, interactions, rules, and social\nnorms can be defined.A typical design of the sandbox [27 ] employs latent sandbox rules as\nincentives to guide emergent behaviors, aligning them more closely with human preferences.The\nextensibility supports iterative prototyping of diverse agent societies.5.2.3 Physical Environment\nAs previously discussed, the text-based environment has limited expressiveness for modeling dynamic\nenvironments.While the virtual sandbox environment provides modularized simulations, it lacks\nauthentic embodied experiences.In contrast, the physical environment refers to the tangible and\n37\n\nreal-world surroundings which consist of actual physical objects and spaces.For instance, within\na household physical environment [ 516 ], tangible surfaces and spaces can be occupied by real-\nworld objects such as plates.This physical reality is significantly more complex, posing additional\nchallenges for LLM-based agents:\n• \nSensory perception and processing.The physical environment introduces a rich tapestry of\nsensory inputs with real-world objects.It incorporates visual [ 120 ; 333 ], auditory [ 375 ; 377 ]\nand spatial senses.While this diversity enhances interactivity and sensory immersion, it also\nintroduces the complexity of simultaneous perception.Agents must process sensory inputs to\ninteract effectively with their surroundings.• Motion control.Unlike virtual environments, physical spaces impose realistic constraints on ac-\ntions through embodiment.Action sequences generated by LLM-based agents should be adaptable\nto the environment.It means that the physical environment necessitates executable and grounded\nmotion control [ 258 ].For example, imagine an agent operating a robotic arm in a factory.Grasping\nobjects with different textures requires precision tuning and controlled force, which prevents\ndamage to items.Moreover, the agent must navigate the physical workspace and make real-time\nadjustments, avoiding obstacles and optimizing the trajectory of the arm.In summary, to effectively interact within tangible spaces, agents must undergo hardware-specific\nand scenario-specific training to develop adaptive abilities that can transfer from virtual to physical\nenvironments.We will discuss more in the following section (§ 6.5).5.3 Society Simulation with LLM-based Agents\nThe concept of “Simulated Society” in this section serves as a dynamic system where agents engage\nin intricate interactions within a well-defined environment.Recent research on simulated societies\nhas followed two primary lines, namely, exploring the boundaries of the collective intelligence\ncapabilities of LLM-based agents [109 ; 405 ; 130 ; 406 ; 410 ] and using them to accelerate discoveries\nin the social sciences [ 22; 518 ; 542 ].In addition, there are also a number of noteworthy studies, e.g.,\nusing simulated societies to collect synthetic datasets [108 ; 519 ; 543 ], helping people to simulate rare\nyet difficult interpersonal situations [544 ; 545 ].With the foundation of the previous sections (§ 5.1,\n5.2), here we will introduce the key properties and mechanism of agent society (§ 5.3.1), what we\ncan learn from emergent social phenomena (§ 5.3.2), and finally the potential ethical and social risks\nin it (§ 5.3.3).5.3.1 Key Properties and Mechanism of Agent Society\nSocial simulation can be categorized into macro-level simulation and micro-level simulation [ 518 ].In the macro-level simulation, also known as system-based simulation, researchers model the overall\nstate of the system of the simulated society [ 546 ; 547 ].While micro-level simulation, also known as\nagent-based simulation or Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), indirectly simulates society by modeling\nindividuals [548 ; 549 ].With the development of LLM-based agents, micro-level simulation has\ngained prominence recently [22 ; 174 ].In this article, we characterize that the “Agent Society” refers\nto an open, persistent, situated, and organized framework [ 521 ] where LLM-based agents interact\nwith each other in a defined environment.Each of these attributes plays a pivotal role in shaping the\nharmonious appearance of the simulated society.In the following paragraphs, we analyze how the\nsimulated society operates through discussing these properties:\n• Open.One of the defining features of simulated societies lies in their openness, both in terms of\ntheir constituent agents and their environmental components.Agents, the primary actors within such\nsocieties, have the flexibility to enter or leave the environment without disrupting its operational\nintegrity [550 ].Furthermore, this feature extends to the environment itself, which can be expanded\nby adding or removing entities in the virtual or physical world, along with adaptable resources like\ntool APIs.Additionally, humans can also participate in societies by assuming the role of an agent\nor serving as the “inner voice” guiding these agents [22 ].This inherent openness adds another level\nof complexity to the simulation, blurring the lines between simulation and reality.• Persistent.We expect persistence and sustainability from the simulated society.While individual\nagents within the society exercise autonomy in their actions over each time step [ 22 ; 518 ], the\noverall organizational structure persists through time, to a degree detached from the transient\n38\n\nbehaviors of individual agents.This persistence creates an environment where agents’ decisions\nand behaviors accumulate, leading to a coherent societal trajectory that develops through time.The system operates independently, contributing to society’s stability while accommodating the\ndynamic nature of its participants.• \nSituated.The situated nature of the society emphasizes its existence and operation within a distinct\nenvironment.This environment is artificially or automatically constructed in advance, and agents\nexecute their behaviors and interactions effectively within it.A noteworthy aspect of this attribute\nis that agents possess an awareness of their spatial context, understanding their location within the\nenvironment and the objects within their field of view [ 22 ; 190 ].This awareness contributes to\ntheir ability to interact proactively and contextually.• Organized.The simulated society operates within a meticulously organized framework, mirroring\nthe systematic structure present in the real world.Just as the physical world adheres to physics\nprinciples, the simulated society operates within predefined rules and limitations.In the simu-\nlated world, agents interact with the environment in a limited action space, while objects in the\nenvironment transform in a limited state space.All of these rules determine how agents operate,\nfacilitating the communication connectivity and information transmission pathways, among other\naspects in simulation [ 207 ].This organizational framework ensures that operations are coherent\nand comprehensible, ultimately leading to an ever-evolving yet enduring simulation that mirrors\nthe intricacies of real-world systems.5.3.2 Insights from Agent Society\nFollowing the exploration of how simulated society works, this section delves into the emergent social\nphenomena in agent society.In the realm of social science, the pursuit of generalized representations\nof individuals, groups, and their intricate dynamics has long been a shared objective [ 551 ; 552 ].The\nemergence of LLM-based agents allows us to take a more microscopic view of simulated society,\nwhich leads to more discoveries from the new representation.Organized productive cooperation.Society simulation offers valuable insights into innovative col-\nlaboration patterns, which have the potential to enhance real-world management strategies.Research\nhas demonstrated that within this simulated society, the integration of diverse experts introduces a\nmultifaceted dimension of individual intelligence [108; 447 ].When dealing with complex tasks, such\nas software development or consulting, the presence of agents with various backgrounds, abilities,\nand experiences facilitates creative problem-solving [109 ; 410 ].Furthermore, diversity functions\nas a system of checks and balances, effectively preventing and rectifying errors through interaction,\nultimately improving the adaptability to various tasks.Through numerous iterations of interactions\nand debates among agents, individual errors like hallucination or degeneration of thought (DoT) are\ncorrected by the group [112].Efficient communication also plays a pivotal role in such a large and complex collaborative group.For example, MetaGPT [405 ] has artificially formulated communication styles with reference to\nstandardized operating procedures (SOPs), validating the effectiveness of empirical methods.Park et\nal.[22 ] observed agents working together to organize a Valentine’s Day party through spontaneous\ncommunication in a simulated town.Propagation in social networks.As simulated social systems can model what might happen in the\nreal world, they can be used as a reference for predicting social processes.", "relevant_output": "Rating: [[Relevant]]  \nAnalysis: The snippet contains key information about multiple LLM agents playing different roles and cooperating to solve tasks, which directly addresses the question.

{"idx": 12, "dataset": "longbench-chat", "query": "Summarize the code changes that the RETRO transformer made to the original transformer.", "answer": ["According to the provided code, the RETRO transformer makes the following major changes from the standard transformer model: 1. **Chunkwise Attention**: - In the `ParallelRetroTransformerLayer` class, a new way of computing attention is used, by splitting the sequence input into small chunks (chunks) and applying cross-attention to each of these chunks. This is mainly done in the `forward` method by padding, reshaping and slicing `hidden_states`. 2. **Cross Attention Integration**: - RETRO transformer integrates cross-attention layers (`ParallelRetroTransformerEncoderLayer` and `ParallelRetroTransformerLayer`) in its layers, which integrates cross-attention layers for merging the retrieved information into the context of the moment. 3. **Retriever Integration**: - The `ParallelRetroTransformerEncoderLayer` class contains a `retriever`, which may be an externally defined module, which is used to perform the retrieval task. This allows the model to obtain additional contextual information, which is useful for improving the understanding of the language model and for generating specific knowledge-related text. 4. **Modified attention and MLP layers**: - Modified the attention and MLP layers to be compatible with the specific structure of the RETRO transformer. 5. **Additional Layer Normalization**: - Introduced additional layer normalization operations in the `ParallelRetroEncoderTransformerCALayer` class, corresponding to after each cross-attention operation, in order to stabilize training and improve performance. 6. **Configuration Adjustments**: - A number of configuration options specific to the RETRO transformer have been added, such as the length of the retrieval block, the hidden layer dropout setting for the retriever, etc. 7. **Parameter Initialization for New Modules**: - For newly added modules, such as `retriever`, a parameter initialization method has been provided, which helps to improve the model state at training startup. These changes reflect the ability of RETRO transformer to use retrieval mechanisms to improve model performance, thus enabling it to handle large amounts of data more efficiently and to improve the quality of generation of specific knowledge points. These changes involve modifications to the model architecture, data flow, and training dynamics."], "few_shot_scores": [{"answer": " The RETRO Transformer introduces several changes and enhancements to the original Transformer architecture, primarily aimed at improving efficiency, performance, and memory usage, especially in the context of large-scale models.

The encoder is designed to handle cross-attention with retriever outputs, while the decoder is optimized for handling self-attention and cross-attention with the encoder outputs.\n\n2. **Retriever Integration**: The RETRO Transformer integrates a retriever module, which is used to retrieve relevant information from a large corpus and incorporate it into the model's output. This is particularly useful for tasks like question-answering and summarization where external knowledge is beneficial.\n\n3. **LayerNorm Modifications**: The layer normalization layers are updated to potentially include a final layer norm before the output, which can help stabilize training and improve performance.\n\n4. **Dropout and Stochastic Depth**: The use of dropout and stochastic depth (DropPath) is refined to potentially include different dropout rates for different layers, which can help in regularization and prevent overfitting.\n\n5. **Attention Mechanisms**: The attention mechanisms are updated to handle different types of attention, such as self-attention and cross-attention, and to potentially include additional layers for more complex attention patterns.\n\n6. **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**: The MLP components are updated to potentially include a switch mechanism that routes input to different \"experts,\" allowing for more flexible and efficient computation.\n\n7. **Parallelism and Pipeline**: The RETRO Transformer is designed to take advantage of parallel processing, including tensor model parallelism and pipeline parallelism, which allows for training and inference on large models with limited memory resources.\n\n8. **Checkpointing**: The code includes support for activation checkpointing, which is a technique to reduce memory usage during training by storing intermediate activations instead of recomputing them.\n\n9. **Memory Optimizations**: The RETRO Transformer includes optimizations for memory usage, such as making tensors viewless to avoid creating unnecessary views and to reduce memory footprint.\n\n10. **Inference and Training**: The code is structured to support both training and inference modes, with different behaviors and optimizations for each mode.\n\n11. **Configuration and Hyperparameters**: The RETRO Transformer uses a more complex set of hyperparameters and configuration options, allowing for greater flexibility in model architecture and training regimes.\n\n12. **Code Organization**: The code is organized into separate modules for different components of the transformer, such as attention, MLP, and the main transformer layer, which makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n\nThese changes collectively aim to make the RETRO Transformer more adaptable and efficient for large-scale language modeling tasks, particularly those that require integrating external knowledge and handling very long sequences.", "score": 7}, {"answer": "Here is a summary of the main changes the RETRO transformer made to the original transformer code:  1. Added new modules `ParallelRetroTransformerEncoderLayer`, `ParallelRetroTransformerLayer`, and `ParallelRetroEncoderTransformerCALayer` for the encoder and decoder layers that incorporate retrieval. These include cross attention between the main model and retrieved neighbors.  2. Added a `ParallelRetroEncoder` module that is a transformer encoder adapted for retrieval augmentation.  3. Added a `ParallelRetroTransformer` module which is the main RETRO transformer incorporating the retro encoder and decoder layers.  4. Added the ability to route token embeddings to different \"expert\" MLP layers using a router MLP in `SwitchMLP`.  5. Modified existing modules like `ParallelTransformerLayer` to support features needed for RETRO like separate attention dropout values.  6. Added additional command line arguments to configure RETRO hyperparameters like the layers to add retrieval to and retrieved sequence length.  7. Added retrieval infrastructure like storing memories and incorporation of neighbors.  8. Added dropout to attention outputs in some layers and other tweaks to regularization like supporting separate hidden dropout values.  9. Added ability to checkpoint transformer layer activations to save memory.  So in summary, it extends the original transformer with retrieval capabilities and additional techniques to improve efficiency and regularization for large models. But it retains modularization to reuse as much of the original implementation as possible.", "score": 5}, {"answer": "Based on the doc, some key changes made to the original transformer by the RETRO transformer are:  1. Added support for a retrieval encoder by changing the ParallelRetroEncoder class to also have a `P` attribute to specify layers in the retrieval encoder path.  2. Changed some layer names and attributes to reflect the addition of the retrieval encoder. For example, the ParallelRetroEncoderTransformerCALayer class has been added to handle the cross attention with the retrieval encoder.  3. The ParallelTransformerLayer class now has a `retriever_output` input parameter to handle the output from the retrieval encoder.   4. The ParallelRetroEncoderLayer now has the `inter_attention` method to handle the cross attention with the retrieval encoder.  5. A new ParallelRetroEncoder class has been added to handle the encoder path.  6. Changes to enable the retrieval encoder by passing input from it to the decoder path in some layers.  7. The checkpointing code has been updated to account for the retrieval encoder.  So in summary, the key changes are adding the retrieval encoder, changing layer names and attributes, adding the inter-attention cross attention method, and adjusting the checkpointing logic to account for the retrieval encoder.", "score": 3}], "prediction": "The RETRO transformer introduces several key modifications to the original transformer architecture, primarily focused on integrating retrieval capabilities and cross-attention mechanisms.
